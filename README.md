|   Write shy code - modules that |
|   don't reveal anything         |
|   unnecessary to other modules  |
|   and that don't rely on other  |
|   modules' implementations      |
|                                 |
|   -- Unknown                    |
\                                 /
 ---------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
You can also add the command to your shell's `*rc` file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc. or whatever file the shell loads on startup) so it outputs a quote every time you open a new shell.

### Updates
This Repo will be frequently updated with new quotes. Simply run `npm i -g qotm` to get the latest updates. Expect an update notifier to be added in future updates so as to prompt you when new updates are ready.

## Contributing
There are thousands of tech and programming quotes out there. You have your favorites right? Add them to the `contributing.json` file using the specified format and submit a pull request to the `qotm-cli` branch. I'll be happy to pull them in and make them available in subsequent updates. You can also help in any other way you can, be it code refactoring, typo fixes, etc. <br>
*NB*: I may need to verify the quote and it's author. Please do check as well before adding quotes.
